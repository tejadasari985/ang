The Angular CLI was used to generate the base project structure with the ng new command, the CLI is also used to build and serve the application. Each feature has it's own folder (account, home & users), other shared/common code such as components, services, models, helpers etc are placed in folders prefixed with an underscore _ to easily differentiate them from features and group them together at the top of the folder structure. download node js install angular by using command npm install -g @angular/cli
